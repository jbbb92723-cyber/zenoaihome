      'What renovation actually teaches you about decision-making, budgets, and living with imperfection. Based on 16+ years of on-site experience.',

      'Budget traps and how to avoid them. Why the cheapest quote often costs the most. How to evaluate a contractor before signing. What acceptance inspection really means. Why renovation is infrastructure, not consumption.',

      'How restraint, proportion, and everyday choices shape the way a home feels — beyond trends and decorating tips.',

      'Why lighting is the most underrated design element. The case against "Instagram-style" decoration. How material choices affect daily living. What a home looks like after five years — not just on day one.',

      'What AI actually helped me do (and what it didn\'t). How to keep your voice when writing with AI. Why prompts are workflows, not magic spells. The three levels of individual productivity upgrade.',
